        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 02, 2026</p>
        
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Super Notes Pro</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") handles your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

        <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. The Super Notes Pro app is built to be an offline-first application, meaning your notes and personal data remain on your device.</p>

        <h2>1. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
        <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or share any of your personal data on our servers.</strong></p>
        <p>All data created within the app (including notes, folders, and settings) is stored locally on your device using a local database (Hive).</p>

        <h2>2. App Permissions</h2>
        <p>The app may request the following permissions to provide specific features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Used solely to send you local reminders for your notes/tasks that you schedule.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage (Photos/Media/Files):</strong> Used solely for the "Backup & Restore" feature, allowing you to save a backup of your notes to your device or restore from a previously saved file. We do not access other files on your device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>This app does not integrate with third-party analytics or advertising services that track users.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Since we do not store your data on our servers, you are in full control of your data. If you uninstall the app or clear its data, your locally stored notes will be deleted (unless you have created a backup file externally).</p>

        <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to do necessary actions.</p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

        <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at:</p>
